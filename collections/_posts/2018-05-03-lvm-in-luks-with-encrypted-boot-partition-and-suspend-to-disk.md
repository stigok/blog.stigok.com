## WARNING

**This post is over 3 years old and may contain outdated advice, command line
arguments and technologies.** The order of the steps described might still be
relevant, but do make sure to read the latest news about LUKS when issuing
`cryptsetup` commands.

## Preface

### Motivation

I've been wanting to get this working for a long time and in previous attempts I've
had different issues with it, some of which I encountered this time around as well,
but found solutions to. After getting the results I wanted, here are my notes as a
guided setup. I'm sure my future self will appreciate this as well.

### Notes

This setup shows how to set this up for both UEFI and BIOS systems.

Your motivation may be different than mine. I urge you to take a read on what the
different security options LUKS might offer you. I am not a security expert, nor
do I know a lot about cryptography. This will get you a fully encrypted system
(except for the EFI image), but you should do research on your own to figure out
just how secure that is.

Please keep in mind that having an encrypted system brings problems of its own.
It may, for example, make disk recovery harder in case of a disk failure.
No matter what; have your imporant data backed up on a separate disk.

The steps described don't include elaborate explanations. I urge you to look up
the manpages for the things you don't understand. It will expose you to new
tools and different ways of thinking, and you may even end up remembering how
this is done afterwards.

This guide was made while setting up a ThinkPad T470P, a laptop which has an
SSD connected through mSATA that produces long device names. The name of my
physical disk device is `nvme0n1`. This is likely equivalent to `sda` on
other systems and OS distributions.

I am setting up an Arch Linux system here. Some steps and tools (and the
versions of these tools) might be a little different on other distros.

Desired partitioning scheme may, of course, vary. Sizes of my different
partitions are based on my personal usage pattern.

Make sure that your hand-typed password is inside the very first key-slot.
This will reduce boot time. GRUB will try each key-slot in turn.

### Programs used

Multiple programs are used in the task to make this work. Prepare to get to know
these tools just a little bit better.

- `gdisk` (gpt partitioning)
- `cryptsetup` (LUKS)
- `lvm` (logical volume management)
- `grub` (bootloader)
- `mkinitcpio` (initial ramdisk)

## Preparations

Boot up Arch Linux installation media and follow the [official installation
procedure](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Installation_guide) up until
*Partition the disks*.

The main storage device you want to use should be backed up before continuing.

You must know whether or not you're running a UEFI system before continuing.
You can determine this by running `efivar -l` from the Arch installation shell.

## Partitioning

Create a new partition table. Don't exit `gdisk` until we're done setting up
all of the partitions.

    # gdisk /dev/nvme0n1
    o (new partition table)
    y (confirm)

The next step is determined by whether you are installing on a **UEFI or BIOS** system.

**UEFI:** Create en EFI System Partition (ESP). This is the partiton that will contain
the EFI image the computer will initially boot from. I'm allocating 512MB to avoid
potential disk space issues in the years to come.

    n (new partition)
    [blank] (default partition number)
    [blank] (default start sector)
    +512M (last sector)
    ef00 (EFI system)

**BIOS:**

    n (new partition)
    [blank] (default partition number)
    [blank] (default start sector)
    +1M (last sector)
    ef02 (BIOS boot partition)

**BOTH:** Create the boot partition. 1GB is (more than) enough to hold multiple kernels. The
type of this partition is `8300` -- normal Linux filesystem.

    n (new partition)
    [blank] (default partition number)
    [blank] (default start sector)
    +1G (last sector)
    8300 (Linux filesystem)

Create a partition to hold the LVM. I want this partition to span across the
rest of the disk. Subsequent volumes will be created inside this partition
with `lvm`, hence the partition type `8e00`.

    n (new partition)
    [blank] (default partition number)
    [blank] (default start sector)
    [blank] (last sector (all available space))
    8e00 (Linux LVM)

Write changes to disk, then `gdisk` will exit by itself

    w (write changes to disk)
    y (confirm write)

Take a look at the current partition table before continuing. One for EFI or
BIOS, one for boot and the last one for LVM.

    # gdisk -l /dev/nvme0n1
    GPT fdisk (gdisk) version 1.0.3

    Partition table scan:
      MBR: protective
      BSD: not present
      APM: not present
      GPT: present

    Found valid GPT with protective MBR; using GPT.
    Disk /dev/nvme0n1: 1000215216 sectors, 476.9 GiB
    Model: SAMSUNG MZVLW512HMJP-000L7
    Sector size (logical/physical): 512/512 bytes
    Disk identifier (GUID): 06B4B4F3-38BA-41E3-ADF8-140EC87F194B
    Partition table holds up to 128 entries
    Main partition table begins at sector 2 and ends at sector 33
    First usable sector is 34, last usable sector is 1000215182
    Partitions will be aligned on 2048-sector boundaries
    Total free space is 2014 sectors (1007.0 KiB)

    Number  Start (sector)    End (sector)  Size       Code  Name
       1            2048         1050623   512.0 MiB   EF00  EFI System
       2         1050624         3147775   1024.0 MiB  8300  Linux filesystem
       3         3147776      1000215182   475.4 GiB   8E00  Linux LVM

**UEFI:** Create FAT32 file systems on the ESP partition

    # mkfs.vfat -F 32 /dev/nvme0n1p1

File systems for the other partitions will be created after the LUKS and LVM has been set up.

## LUKS and LVM

Create a LUKS container on the root partition. You will be asked for confirmation and prompted
for a passphrase when running this command. **Make sure this passphrase is memorable to you**.

It must also be noted that the amount of hash iterations will increase the time GRUB spends on
decrypting the boot partition. GRUB is not very fast at iterating, so at my system, 100,000
iterations takes roughly 40 secods. This might be an unacceptable wait time. You will have to
benchmark yourself (`cryptsetup benchmark`). Don't worry if you get this wrong the first time
around. It is not overly complicated to re-encrypt the boot partition at a later time.

You have to decide for yourself if customising the parameters for `luksFormat` is worth it.
If you're unsure, remove all of them and use the defaults (`cryptsetup -v luksFormat <device>`).

Read the outputs of these commands carefully. In particular how to say *yes*. Start by creating
the luks container for encrypted boot. The boot partition must be of type `luks1` since support
for LUKS2 headers is missing in GRUB right now ([GRUB bug report](https://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/?55093)).

    # cryptsetup -v --key-size 512 --type luks1 --hash sha256 --iter-time 5000 --use-random luksFormat /dev/nvme0n1p2

Then create the root container

    # cryptsetup -v --key-size 512 --hash sha256 --iter-time 5000 --use-random luksFormat /dev/nvme0n1p3

Open and mount the encrypted containers. Here, *encrypted-lvm* and *encrypted-boot* are the names of which
the containers will be mapped as. They can be named anything you want, but it might make the rest of this
guide harder to read if you change this.

    # cryptsetup open /dev/nvme0n1p2 encrypted-boot
    # cryptsetup open /dev/nvme0n1p3 encrypted-lvm

The containers are now mounted under `/dev/mapper/<container name>`.
Create a LVM physical volume on the lvm container.

    # pvcreate /dev/mapper/encrypted-lvm

Create a volume group to hold all sub-volumes. *Main* is an arbitrary name I chose for my group, which will
make all sub-volumes mapped as `Main-<name>`.

    # vgcreate Main /dev/mapper/encrypted-lvm

Now, let's move on to creating desired logical volumes in the volume group.

Note that the swap partition should be greater than or equal to the amount of system RAM for
suspend-to-disk to work properly (16GB in this case). You can check your system with
`cat /proc/meminfo`.
[According to ArchWiki][Arch Wiki hibernation notes], hibernation *may be successful* even if
the swap partition is smaller than the total system memory, but I want to increase my chances.

    # lvcreate -L 16G Main -n swap

The optimal size of the system partition is up to you to know. My previous Arch installation have used
less than 15GB after a year of not thinking about it. However, your milage may vary greatly.
E.g. if you plan on using Docker with a default setup, all docker images and volumes will be
saved to the root partition under `/var/docker`, which will fill it up rather fast.

    # lvcreate -L 25G Main -n root

My disk is 500GB, but using only `200GB` for the home partition here to leave space for other
operating systems I plan to install in the future. To use all available space, use `100%FREE` instead.

    # lvcreate -L 200G Main -n home

Create filesystems on each logical volume

    # mkfs.ext4 /dev/mapper/Main-root
    # mkfs.ext4 /dev/mapper/Main-home

Set up the swap area

    # mkswap /dev/mapper/Main-swap

And, at last, for the boot partition while we're at it. Note that the **file system for boot
is not `ext4`,** but `ext2`

    # mkfs.ext2 /dev/mapper/encrypted-boot

## Mount the volumes

The order of mounting *matters*. If done incorrectly, e.g. by mounting boot
at `/boot` instead of `/mnt/boot`, will result in missing mounts in `/etc/fstab`
later on.

We are replicating the mounts of the finished system, with the root at `/mnt`.
Start out with the root partition, then mount everything else on top of that.

    # mount /dev/mapper/Main-root /mnt

    # mkdir /mnt/boot
    # mount /dev/mapper/encrypted-boot /mnt/boot

**UEFI:** Be aware that `nvme0n1p1` is in fact the EFI, and that it is mounted *after*
the boot partition has been mounted.

    # mkdir /mnt/boot/efi
    # mount /dev/nvme0n1p1 /mnt/boot/efi

**BIOS:** Don't mount `nvme0n1p1`. GRUB will write to it later without mounting it.

**BOTH:** Mount the home partition

    # mkdir /mnt/home
    # mount /dev/mapper/Main-home /mnt/home

Enable swap

    # swapon /dev/mapper/Main-swap

---

Unless you're installing Arch Linux yourself, you'd probably want to skip directly
the next step. However, it might be smart to glance through here to understand how
my system is set up.

If you find it hard to follow the next steps, consult [the official installation
guide's installation section](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Installation_guide#Installation).

## Prepare for chroot

If you're plugged in with ethernet but haven't configured an IP address yet, try
get one through DHCP before continuing, as it expects a working internet connection.
Again, I have a crazy device name. *enp0s31f6* might be *eth0* on other systems or
distros.

    # dhclient enp0s31f6

You should now be connected to the internet.

Install base packages. Add *your* favorite editor instead of `vim` if you'd like,
and skip adding `efibootmgr` if you are **not** on a **UEFI** system.

    # pacstrap /mnt base base-devel linux lvm2 vim grub mkinitcpio efibootmgr

Generate the fstab then *open the file to see if it looks right*

    # genfstab -U /mnt >> /mnt/etc/fstab

Change root to the new system

    # arch-chroot /mnt

## System Configuration

Set the time zone and sync the hardware clock, assuming it is set to UTC

    # ln -sf /usr/share/zoneinfo/Europe/Oslo /etc/localtime
    # hwclock --systohc

Configure desired locales in `/etc/locale.gen` then generate them

    # locale-gen

Configure your defaults in `/etc/locale.conf`. I want English language
with Norwegian date and time formats

    # cat > /etc/locale.conf
    LANG=en_US.UTF-8
    LC_TIME=nb_NO.UTF-8

## Create initial Ramdisk

These next steps assumes the root of your **new** system is at `/`. Since this is
an Arch installation, the system has changed root with `arch-chroot /mnt`, and the
new root is within the new system.

Configure your keymap and font in `/etc/vconsole.conf` (optional).
Depending on your password, setting the correct keymap may be crucial
to be able to boot. **If you forgot to do this and you're reading here
to try and save your ass**, there are [kernel boot params that can set the
keymap](https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E52668_01/E54669/html/section_a43_3bk_q4.html).

    # example /etc/vconsole.conf
    KEYMAP=us
    FONT=sun12x22

Open up `/etc/mkinitcpio.conf` and update the `HOOKS`. Here, too, the order matters.

    HOOKS=(base udev keyboard keymap consolefont autodetect modconf block encrypt lvm2 resume decryption-keys filesystems fsck)

I am using `keyboard` before `autodetect` to load all keyboard drivers.
If an external keyboard is connected later on (e.g. by docking) and `keyboard` has been set
*after* `autodetect`, it may not have a driver available and will be unusable for entering
the luks passphrase. Make special note to the presence of `resume` which is required for
suspend-to-disk to work.

`decryption-keys` is a custom hook we will implement ourselves in order to
add files to the root of the initramfs without keeping the files in our root
filesystem (as we have to if we use the `FILES` array). Create a new file
at `/etc/initcpio/install/decryption-keys`, and fill it with the below.
([Full version of this script](https://gist.github.com/stigok/7c8d3c872fae5573a870ecd86a4c896c) is in a gist.)

    #!/bin/bash
    # This is /etc/initcpio/install/decryption-keys
    function build {
      for file in /etc/initcpio/keys/*; do
        add_file "$file" "/$(basename $file)" 0400
      done
    }

Create keyfiles inside `/etc/initcpio/keys/` to automatically open the encrypted LVM partition
after boot has been manually decrypted. Optionally source from `/dev/urandom` to avoid the possibility
of waiting *forever* for enough entropy. You have the opportunity to [know the difference][random urandom] if
you don't already do.

We are creating keyfiles of `512 * 8` bytes (4096) each

    # mkdir -p /etc/initcpio/keys
    # dd bs=512 count=8 iflag=fullblock if=/dev/random of=/etc/initcpio/keys/encrypted-boot.key
    # dd bs=512 count=8 iflag=fullblock if=/dev/random of=/etc/initcpio/keys/encrypted-lvm.key

Set proper permissions and make it real hard to accidentally do something
to these files

    # chmod 0000 /etc/initcpio/keys/*
    # chattr +i /etc/initcpio/keys/*

Add the *encrypted-boot* keyfile as a decryption key for the boot partition. You will be asked
to enter the passphrase for this encrypted LUKS partition.

    # cryptsetup luksAddKey /dev/nvme0n1p2 /etc/initcpio/keys/encrypted-boot.key

Do the same for the *encrypted-lvm* partition

    # cryptsetup luksAddKey /dev/nvme0n1p3 /etc/initcpio/keys/encrypted-lvm.key

Now that the LVM container has a keyfile attached, the passphrase used
initially when creating the LUKS container **can optionally** be removed
from the device. If this is done, unlocking the boot partition is the **only
way** to recover the key-file used to unlock the LVM partition.
**Use the below command with caution**. Depending on your security
threat-model, this might be unnecessary.

    # # Skip this step if you don't understand the risks.
    # cryptsetup luksKillSlot /dev/nvme0n1p3 0 --key-file /etc/initcpio/keys/encrypted-lvm.key

Create the initial ramdisk environment and make sure it doesn't return any errors.
Some warning may show, but errors should not occur.

    # mkinitcpio -p linux

Set strict permissions for the ramdisk images now that the decryption keys
are embedded in them

    # chmod 0400 /boot/initramfs-linux*

These permissions will be reset every time `mkinitcpio` is run. Typically it
is automatically triggered after a package install or upgrade occurs that
touches either `/boot/vmlinuz-linux` or `/usr/lib/initcpio/*`. To make sure
permissions are properly set after every upgrade, create a post-transaction
hook for pacman inside `/etc/pacman.d/hooks/99-initramfs-chmod.hook`:

    [Trigger]
    Type = File
    Operation = Install
    Operation = Upgrade
    Target = boot/vmlinuz-linux
    Target = usr/lib/initcpio/*

    [Action]
    Description = Setting proper permissions for linux initcpios...
    When = PostTransaction
    Exec = /usr/bin/chmod 0400 /boot/initramfs-linux.img /boot/initramfs-linux-fallback.img

Make sure this works as intended by re-installing mkinitcpio

    # pacman -S mkinitcpio

You should see a line in the output confirming that the script ran

    :: Running post-transaction hooks...
    [ redacted ]
    (4/5) Updating linux initcpios...
    [ redacted ]
    (5/5) Setting proper permissions for linux initcpios...
    [ redacted ]

And see that the permissions actually changed

    # stat -c '%a %A %n' /boot/initramfs-linux*
    400 -r-------- /boot/initramfs-linux-fallback.img
    400 -r-------- /boot/initramfs-linux.img

## Create bootloader with GRUB

Update the following line in `/etc/default/grub`

    GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX="cryptdevice=UUID=%uuid%:encrypted-lvm root=/dev/mapper/Main-root resume=/dev/mapper/Main-swap cryptkey=rootfs:/encrypted-lvm.key"

And, in the same file, un-comment the `GRUB_ENABLE_CRYPTODISK=y` to enable booting
from an encrypted system.

Then replace `%uuid%` with the UUID of the LVM partition.
This can of course be done manually, but when stuck in a terminal, it might be
easier to do with `sed`

    # sed -i s/%uuid%/$(blkid -o value -s UUID /dev/nvme0n1p3)/ /etc/default/grub

**BIOS:** Register GRUB on the MBR. Note that the reference is to the disk
(*nvme0n1)*, **not** to the partition (*nvme0n1p1*):

    # grub-install --target=i386-pc /dev/nvme0n1

**UEFI:** verify that the ESP is mounted to `/boot/efi`
with `lsblk`, then install the bootloader to the ESP

    # grub-install --target=x86_64-efi --efi-directory=/boot/efi --bootloader-id=grub --recheck

**Both:** Generate GRUB configuration.
It's okay to get `WARNING: Failed to connect to lvmetad` while inside the chroot.

    # grub-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg

Create an entry in `/etc/crypttab` to make systemd decrypt and mount the
boot partition automatically on successful boot using its keyfile

    # inside /etc/crypttab
    encrypted-boot UUID=%uuid% /etc/initcpio/keys/encrypted-boot.key luks

Again, replace `%uuid%` with the actual UUID of the boot partition at `/dev/nvme0n1p2`

    # sed -i s/%uuid%/$(blkid -o value -s UUID /dev/nvme0n1p2)/ /etc/crypttab

All set! Rebooting is the only way to figure out if it was set up correctly
or not.

    # exit
    # reboot

Please send me an e-mail if you have any troubles -- or if you didn't!

## Troubleshooting

### Dumped to GRUB rescue shell

If you are dumped to grub rescue mode when booting, chances are that there's
a typo or two somewhere in your configuration files. To avoid having to start
over again from scratch, you can boot again with the Arch Linux installation
media and unlock, mount and chroot back to where you were before rebooting.

```terminal
# cryptsetup open /dev/sda3 encrypted-lvm
# mount /dev/mapper/Main-root /mnt
# cryptsetup open /dev/sda2 encrypted-boot
# mount /dev/mapper/encrypted-boot /mnt/boot
# mount /dev/sda1 /mnt/boot/efi
# mount /dev/mapper/Main-home /mnt/home
# swapon /dev/mapper/Main-swap
# arch-chroot /mnt
```

If you want to dig through the rescue mode, you can see my [other post covering
possible recovery][grub rescue post] from the shell itself.
